### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: finite offline coverage; native backend unverified. Unsupported commit reuse requires fresh QA; publication is not authorized.

### Evidence
Fresh actual PTO010 regression assessment: reviews/pto-010-regression-review.md.49 original AC unchanged; existing89 orchestration/54runtime/26binding plus19 adapter tests passed. Prior full source evidence is historical; expanded full gate is pending. No native support or publication claimed.

### Review Completeness Gate
- Status: complete
- Reviewed baseline: HEAD8a0eeef and current approved PTO001..009 source; current planning/capture progress regression
- Closure freshness: current
- Post-fix full re-review: completed
- Policy-boundary adversarial matrix: completed
- Producer-consumer field audit: completed
- Required-field mapping: complete
- Instruction refresh: performed-full
- Instruction baseline: current
- Cross-contract consistency: aligned
- Risk/work mode compatibility: aligned
- Source-of-truth, permissions, phase gates, artifact state, and acceptance criteria reviewed: yes
- Negative-space / adversarial review: completed
- Automated evidence role: supporting-only
- Producers/consumers reviewed: current QA, capture, scoped inventory and orchestration parent gates
- Evidence: reviews/pto-010-regression-review.md; current original behaviors and adapter design reviewed.

### QA Verification Scope
Specification of PTO-ALLOC-002-adaptive-allocation: testable readiness design, DoD/scope/dependencies, safety and planned verification. Does not authorize implementation or claim runtime correctness.

### Artifact QA Completeness Gate
- Owner intent and governing sources reviewed: context.md, decisions/owner-decisions.md, installed parallel/autopilot/risk/QA contracts
- DoD / phase acceptance criteria reviewed: yes
- Scope and out-of-scope consistency: aligned
- Artifact / relevant diff review: completed
- Findings-first review: completed
- Failure / rework / dependency scenarios: completed
- Repository and source compatibility: aligned
- Post-fix full artifact re-review: completed
- Evidence reviewed: reviews/specifications-review.md and current source contracts bound below
- Skipped or unreadable sources: live native runtime tests intentionally deferred to implementation
- Residual risk: actual runtime support and net speedup not established
- Closure freshness: current

### Checks
| Check | Result | Evidence | Finding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spec contract/DoD/quality routes | PASS | PTO-002 AC, Plan Quality Contract and slices | none |
| Intent/plan/architecture consistency | PASS | mapped task scope and decisions | none |
| Dependencies/readiness | PASS | predecessor and owner gates explicit, no hidden readiness | none |
| Negative-space and consumer review | PASS | specifications-review.md task row and traces | none |

### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: finite offline coverage; native backend unverified. Unsupported commit reuse requires fresh QA; publication is not authorized.

### Evidence
Fresh substantive regression assessment: reviews/pto-008-prerequisite-regression.md. Actual original acceptance conditions, changed shared consumers, opt-in V3 and strict V2 were reviewed against current source and completed progress. Current full002 exit0,685seconds,44checks,757IDs is supporting evidence; 26 binding/CLI,54runtime,89orchestration tests passed. Prior assessment details remain under Historical Runs. Artifact QA does not issue implementation PASS; implementation Quality retains its own DoD, intent/completeness and findings review. No native support, current source commit, push or final-owner approval is claimed.

### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: finite offline coverage; native backend unverified. Unsupported commit reuse requires fresh QA; publication is not authorized.

### Evidence
Fresh substantive regression assessment: reviews/pto-008-prerequisite-regression.md. Actual original acceptance conditions, changed shared consumers, opt-in V3 and strict V2 were reviewed against current source and completed progress. Current full002 exit0,685seconds,44checks,757IDs is supporting evidence; 26 binding/CLI,54runtime,89orchestration tests passed. Prior assessment details remain under Historical Runs. Artifact QA does not issue implementation PASS; implementation Quality retains its own DoD, intent/completeness and findings review. No native support, current source commit, push or final-owner approval is claimed.

### Review Completeness Gate
- Status: complete
- Reviewed baseline: HEAD8a0eeef and current approved PTO001..009 source; current planning/capture progress regression
- Closure freshness: current
- Post-fix full re-review: completed
- Policy-boundary adversarial matrix: completed
- Producer-consumer field audit: completed
- Required-field mapping: complete
- Instruction refresh: performed-full
- Instruction baseline: current
- Cross-contract consistency: aligned
- Risk/work mode compatibility: aligned
- Source-of-truth, permissions, phase gates, artifact state, and acceptance criteria reviewed: yes
- Negative-space / adversarial review: completed
- Automated evidence role: supporting-only
- Producers/consumers reviewed: current QA, capture, scoped inventory and orchestration parent gates
- Evidence: reviews/pto-008-prerequisite-regression.md and original task review evidence; all previous runs preserved as history.

### QA Verification Scope
Specification of PTO-ALLOC-002-adaptive-allocation: testable readiness design, DoD/scope/dependencies, safety and planned verification. Does not authorize implementation or claim runtime correctness.

### Artifact QA Completeness Gate
- Owner intent and governing sources reviewed: context.md, decisions/owner-decisions.md, installed parallel/autopilot/risk/QA contracts
- DoD / phase acceptance criteria reviewed: yes
- Scope and out-of-scope consistency: aligned
- Artifact / relevant diff review: completed
- Findings-first review: completed
- Failure / rework / dependency scenarios: completed
- Repository and source compatibility: aligned
- Post-fix full artifact re-review: completed
- Evidence reviewed: reviews/specifications-review.md and current source contracts bound below
- Skipped or unreadable sources: live native runtime tests intentionally deferred to implementation
- Residual risk: actual runtime support and net speedup not established
- Closure freshness: current

- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: native backend isolation and performance remain unverified until implementation tests.

### Evidence
Task PTO-ALLOC-002-adaptive-allocation: reviewed complete specification, 5 AC, explicit files, 3 grouped regression scenarios, slice plan, data/failure trace and formal future gates. Evidence: reviews/specifications-review.md. Semantic review only; no implementation or native test claimed. Fresh complete re-review after correcting task-index future Phase 5 links; prior run remains historical and cannot authorize this baseline. Final consumer audit binds owned runtime inventory requirement for orchestration; complete current plan/spec re-review performed.

### Review Completeness Gate
- Status: complete
- Reviewed baseline: HEAD 8a0eeef5dcee4a4c9852cb495bdae6e92115a0e1 and hashed specification/plan/architecture/decision/review inputs
- Closure freshness: current
- Post-fix full re-review: completed
- Policy-boundary adversarial matrix: completed
- Producer-consumer field audit: completed
- Required-field mapping: complete

### QA Verification Scope
Specification of PTO-ALLOC-002-adaptive-allocation: testable readiness design, DoD/scope/dependencies, safety and planned verification. Does not authorize implementation or claim runtime correctness.

### Artifact QA Completeness Gate
- Owner intent and governing sources reviewed: context.md, decisions/owner-decisions.md, installed parallel/autopilot/risk/QA contracts
- DoD / phase acceptance criteria reviewed: yes
- Scope and out-of-scope consistency: aligned
- Artifact / relevant diff review: completed
- Findings-first review: completed
- Failure / rework / dependency scenarios: completed
- Repository and source compatibility: aligned
- Post-fix full artifact re-review: completed
- Evidence reviewed: reviews/specifications-review.md and current source contracts bound below
- Skipped or unreadable sources: live native runtime tests intentionally deferred to implementation
- Residual risk: actual runtime support and net speedup not established
- Closure freshness: current

### Checks
| Check | Result | Evidence | Finding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spec contract/DoD/quality routes | PASS | PTO-002 AC, Plan Quality Contract and slices | none |
| Intent/plan/architecture consistency | PASS | mapped task scope and decisions | none |
| Dependencies/readiness | PASS | predecessor and owner gates explicit, no hidden readiness | none |
| Negative-space and consumer review | PASS | specifications-review.md task row and traces | none |
| Post-fix whole artifact review | PASS | checkpoint reservation, lifecycle and test entrypoint refinements | resolved |

### Gate Decision
- Spec QA result: PASS
- Required next phase: phase-4-implementation

### Execution Authority
Artifact-only PASS. No high-risk implementation approval or ready implementation-range is supplied. Future start must verify owner approval, dependencies, isolation and current instructions/spec inputs.

### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: native backend isolation and performance remain unverified until implementation tests.

### Evidence
Task PTO-ALLOC-002-adaptive-allocation: reviewed complete specification, 5 AC, explicit files, 3 grouped regression scenarios, slice plan, data/failure trace and formal future gates. Evidence: reviews/specifications-review.md. Semantic review only; no implementation or native test claimed. Fresh complete re-review after correcting task-index future Phase 5 links; prior run remains historical and cannot authorize this baseline. Final consumer audit binds owned runtime inventory requirement for orchestration; complete current plan/spec re-review performed.

### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: native backend isolation and performance remain unverified until implementation tests.

### Evidence
Task PTO-ALLOC-002-adaptive-allocation: reviewed complete specification, 5 AC, explicit files, 3 grouped regression scenarios, slice plan, data/failure trace and formal future gates. Evidence: reviews/specifications-review.md. Semantic review only; no implementation or native test claimed. Fresh complete re-review after correcting task-index future Phase 5 links; prior run remains historical and cannot authorize this baseline. Final consumer audit binds owned runtime inventory requirement for orchestration; complete current plan/spec re-review performed.

### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: native backend isolation and performance remain unverified until implementation tests.

### Evidence
Task PTO-ALLOC-002-adaptive-allocation: reviewed complete specification, 5 AC, explicit files, 3 grouped regression scenarios, slice plan, data/failure trace and formal future gates. Evidence: reviews/specifications-review.md. Semantic review only; no implementation or native test claimed. Fresh complete re-review after correcting task-index future Phase 5 links; prior run remains historical and cannot authorize this baseline. Final consumer audit binds owned runtime inventory requirement for orchestration; complete current plan/spec re-review performed.

### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: native backend isolation and performance remain unverified until implementation tests.

### Evidence
Task PTO-ALLOC-002-adaptive-allocation: reviewed complete specification, 5 AC, explicit files, 3 grouped regression scenarios, slice plan, data/failure trace and formal future gates. Evidence: reviews/specifications-review.md. Semantic review only; no implementation or native test claimed. Fresh complete re-review after correcting task-index future Phase 5 links; prior run remains historical and cannot authorize this baseline. Final consumer audit binds owned runtime inventory requirement for orchestration; complete current plan/spec re-review performed.

### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: native backend isolation and performance remain unverified until implementation tests.

### Evidence
Task PTO-ALLOC-002-adaptive-allocation: reviewed complete specification, 5 AC, explicit files, 3 grouped regression scenarios, slice plan, data/failure trace and formal future gates. Evidence: reviews/specifications-review.md. Semantic review only; no implementation or native test claimed. Fresh complete re-review after correcting task-index future Phase 5 links; prior run remains historical and cannot authorize this baseline. Final consumer audit binds owned runtime inventory requirement for orchestration; complete current plan/spec re-review performed.

### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: native backend isolation and performance remain unverified until implementation tests.

### Evidence
Task PTO-ALLOC-002-adaptive-allocation: reviewed complete specification, 5 AC, explicit files, 3 grouped regression scenarios, slice plan, data/failure trace and formal future gates. Evidence: reviews/specifications-review.md. Semantic review only; no implementation or native test claimed. Fresh complete re-review after correcting task-index future Phase 5 links; prior run remains historical and cannot authorize this baseline. Final consumer audit binds owned runtime inventory requirement for orchestration; complete current plan/spec re-review performed.
Fresh complete prerequisite regression review: reviews/prerequisite-refresh-001.md. Changed autopilot policy preserves all accepted architecture/plan/spec boundaries; implementation gate is distinct and current owner implementation approval is recorded.

### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: native backend isolation and performance remain unverified until implementation tests.

### Evidence
Task PTO-ALLOC-002-adaptive-allocation: reviewed complete specification, 5 AC, explicit files, 3 grouped regression scenarios, slice plan, data/failure trace and formal future gates. Evidence: reviews/specifications-review.md. Semantic review only; no implementation or native test claimed. Fresh complete re-review after correcting task-index future Phase 5 links; prior run remains historical and cannot authorize this baseline. Final consumer audit binds owned runtime inventory requirement for orchestration; complete current plan/spec re-review performed.
Fresh complete prerequisite regression review: reviews/prerequisite-refresh-001.md. Changed autopilot policy preserves all accepted architecture/plan/spec boundaries; implementation gate is distinct and current owner implementation approval is recorded.

### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: native backend isolation and performance remain unverified until implementation tests.

### Evidence
Task PTO-ALLOC-002-adaptive-allocation: reviewed complete specification, 5 AC, explicit files, 3 grouped regression scenarios, slice plan, data/failure trace and formal future gates. Evidence: reviews/specifications-review.md. Semantic review only; no implementation or native test claimed. Fresh complete re-review after correcting task-index future Phase 5 links; prior run remains historical and cannot authorize this baseline. Final consumer audit binds owned runtime inventory requirement for orchestration; complete current plan/spec re-review performed.
Fresh complete prerequisite regression review: reviews/prerequisite-refresh-001.md. Changed autopilot policy preserves all accepted architecture/plan/spec boundaries; implementation gate is distinct and current owner implementation approval is recorded.

### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: native backend isolation and performance remain unverified until implementation tests.

### Evidence
Task PTO-ALLOC-002-adaptive-allocation: reviewed complete specification, 5 AC, explicit files, 3 grouped regression scenarios, slice plan, data/failure trace and formal future gates. Evidence: reviews/specifications-review.md. Semantic review only; no implementation or native test claimed. Fresh complete re-review after correcting task-index future Phase 5 links; prior run remains historical and cannot authorize this baseline. Final consumer audit binds owned runtime inventory requirement for orchestration; complete current plan/spec re-review performed.
Fresh complete prerequisite regression review: reviews/prerequisite-refresh-001.md. Changed autopilot policy preserves all accepted architecture/plan/spec boundaries; implementation gate is distinct and current owner implementation approval is recorded.

Evidence: reviews/specifications-review.md. Semantic review only; no implementation or native test claimed. Fresh complete re-review after correcting task-index future Phase 5 links; prior run remains historical and cannot authorize this baseline. Final consumer audit binds owned runtime inventory requirement for orchestration; complete current plan/spec re-review performed.
Fresh complete prerequisite regression review: reviews/prerequisite-refresh-001.md. Changed autopilot policy preserves all accepted architecture/plan/spec boundaries; implementation gate is distinct and current owner implementation approval is recorded.
