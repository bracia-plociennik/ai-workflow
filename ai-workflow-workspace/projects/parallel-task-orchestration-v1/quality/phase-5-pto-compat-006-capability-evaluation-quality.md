### Evidence
- Current semantic compatibility review: accepted task/specification scopes, completed/deferred task rows, original DoD conclusions and failure boundaries were re-read. All original owning-project inputs matched their recorded hashes before rendering.
- Source deltas add opt-in execution/commit capabilities; legacy V2/schema1/schema2 readers remain strict. The new fixed dependency classification affects inventory and both evidence readers only. Every other runtime link remains rejected; excluded dependencies cannot supply evidence.
- Fresh full product validation in an isolated current-worktree fixture completed with all five smoke groups and no skipped tests; the additional dependency regression and frozen manifest integrity passed. This is source verification, not an assertion that the original upstream runtime had already passed its full gate.
- No old receipt was reused: old HMAC/environment fingerprints and performance results remain historical. This run makes no new timing or whole-agent improvement claim.
- Original findings and project outcomes remain unchanged. LV005 stays deferred with FAIL and unmet paired-model/isolation evidence; there is no new model evaluation or promotion.
- Original report preserved byte-for-byte at history/2026-10-05-pre-dependency-scope/phase-5-pto-compat-006-capability-evaluation-quality.md; the new assessment has a distinct run identity and current input graph. Historical owner closure remains scoped to its original decision; this review grants no new final-owner-yes, publication or activation.

### Definition Of Done Validation
| DoD Item | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PTO-006-AC1 | PASS | Schema-1 coordinator output remains compatible; schema-2 is explicit opt-in and always execution_authorized=false.; reviewed in reviews/pto-001-006-final-regression.md |
| PTO-006-AC2 | PASS | Capability distinguishes installed protocol/modes/schemas from backend isolation/capacity and owner permission.; reviewed in reviews/pto-001-006-final-regression.md |
| PTO-006-AC3 | PASS | Unknown/malformed/version mismatch causes conservative fallback; no nested update.; reviewed in reviews/pto-001-006-final-regression.md |
| PTO-006-AC4 | PASS | Offline common fixtures cover authority, conflicts, ordering, recovery and failure paths; original smoke IDs remain exactly once.; reviewed in reviews/pto-001-006-final-regression.md |
| PTO-006-AC5 | PASS | At least three paired serial/parallel synthetic samples use same work/assertions; report total, integration, rework, conflicts and quality; no invented speedup.; reviewed in reviews/pto-001-006-final-regression.md |
| PTO-006-AC6 | PASS | Ship installed protocol capability with native operational support unverified and not authorized; missing or unverified isolation must prohibit native dispatch. Native backend verification is explicitly deferred to a separate owner-approved follow-up; no model/native speedup or isolation claim is part of this release.; reviewed in reviews/pto-001-006-final-regression.md |

- Policy-boundary adversarial matrix: completed
- Producer-consumer field audit: completed
- Required-field mapping: complete
- Instruction refresh: performed-full
- Instruction baseline: current
- Cross-contract consistency: aligned
- Risk/work mode compatibility: aligned
- Source-of-truth, permissions, phase gates, artifact state, and acceptance criteria reviewed: yes
- Negative-space / adversarial review: completed
- Automated evidence role: supporting-only
- Producers/consumers reviewed: current QA, capture, scoped inventory and orchestration parent gates
- Evidence: reviews/pto-010-regression-review.md; current original behaviors and adapter design reviewed.
- Reviewed baseline: b234eb6d8dd13cdab1f5be26fd6efa1b5834fc05; exact current input table; reviewed compatibility follow-up on 2026-10-05
- Compatibility re-review: current accepted specs and source producer/consumer graph reviewed; fixed dependency exclusion, metadata/status, immutable smoke assertions and failed-state rejection checked.
- Freshness evidence: new current hashes and isolated full product verification; original measurements and approval facts remain only historical.

### Adaptive Data / Integration Verification Matrix
- Applicability: required
| Source Shape | Expected Canonical State | Expected Derived Output | Forbidden States/Rows | Failure Behavior | Automated Check | Manual Trace |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Guidance routes approved existing units | same single owner and parent gates | bounded protocol proposal, task QA remains separate | recursive workflow/authority expansion | stop/gate | predecessor77 and docs claim audit | pointer -> canonical -> helper -> task QA |
| Native-unverified installed protocol | unchanged conservative capability | schema1default/schema2opt-in false authority | native/model speed/support claim | ordinary serial/stop | compatibility12/runtime46 | metadata -> consumer -> no dispatch |
| Final source changed only docs | oldreceipt stale | newfull required, fresh closure | oldfull as current proof | reject drift | authenticated full source gate | source -> newfull -> capture/checkpoint |

### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: finite offline coverage; native backend unverified. Unsupported commit reuse requires fresh QA; publication is not authorized.
