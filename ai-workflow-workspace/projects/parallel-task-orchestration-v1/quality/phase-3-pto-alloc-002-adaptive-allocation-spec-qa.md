### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
- Residual risk: finite offline coverage; native backend unverified. Unsupported commit reuse requires fresh QA; publication is not authorized.

### Evidence
- Current semantic compatibility review: accepted task/specification scopes, completed/deferred task rows, original DoD conclusions and failure boundaries were re-read. All original owning-project inputs matched their recorded hashes before rendering.
- Source deltas add opt-in execution/commit capabilities; legacy V2/schema1/schema2 readers remain strict. The new fixed dependency classification affects inventory and both evidence readers only. Every other runtime link remains rejected; excluded dependencies cannot supply evidence.
- Fresh full product validation in an isolated current-worktree fixture completed with all five smoke groups and no skipped tests; the additional dependency regression and frozen manifest integrity passed. This is source verification, not an assertion that the original upstream runtime had already passed its full gate.
- No old receipt was reused: old HMAC/environment fingerprints and performance results remain historical. This run makes no new timing or whole-agent improvement claim.
- Original findings and project outcomes remain unchanged. LV005 stays deferred with FAIL and unmet paired-model/isolation evidence; there is no new model evaluation or promotion.
- Original report preserved byte-for-byte at history/2026-10-05-pre-dependency-scope/phase-3-pto-alloc-002-adaptive-allocation-spec-qa.md; the new assessment has a distinct run identity and current input graph. Historical owner closure remains scoped to its original decision; this review grants no new final-owner-yes, publication or activation.

### Review Completeness Gate
- Status: complete
- Reviewed baseline: b234eb6d8dd13cdab1f5be26fd6efa1b5834fc05; exact current input table; reviewed compatibility follow-up on 2026-10-05
- Closure freshness: current
- Post-fix full re-review: completed
- Policy-boundary adversarial matrix: completed
- Producer-consumer field audit: completed
- Required-field mapping: complete
- Instruction refresh: performed-full
- Instruction baseline: current
- Cross-contract consistency: aligned
- Risk/work mode compatibility: aligned
- Source-of-truth, permissions, phase gates, artifact state, and acceptance criteria reviewed: yes
- Negative-space / adversarial review: completed
- Automated evidence role: supporting-only
- Producers/consumers reviewed: current QA, capture, scoped inventory and orchestration parent gates
- Evidence: reviews/pto-010-regression-review.md; current original behaviors and adapter design reviewed.
- Compatibility re-review: current accepted specs and source producer/consumer graph reviewed; fixed dependency exclusion, metadata/status, immutable smoke assertions and failed-state rejection checked.
- Freshness evidence: new current hashes and isolated full product verification; original measurements and approval facts remain only historical.

### QA Verification Scope
Specification of PTO-ALLOC-002-adaptive-allocation: testable readiness design, DoD/scope/dependencies, safety and planned verification. Does not authorize implementation or claim runtime correctness.
Current follow-up is source compatibility re-review of the same accepted artifact scope, not new implementation or final owner closure.

### Artifact QA Completeness Gate
- Owner intent and governing sources reviewed: context.md, decisions/owner-decisions.md, installed parallel/autopilot/risk/QA contracts
- DoD / phase acceptance criteria reviewed: yes
- Scope and out-of-scope consistency: aligned
- Artifact / relevant diff review: completed
- Findings-first review: completed
- Failure / rework / dependency scenarios: completed
- Repository and source compatibility: aligned
- Post-fix full artifact re-review: completed
- Evidence reviewed: reviews/specifications-review.md and current source contracts bound below
- Skipped or unreadable sources: live native runtime tests intentionally deferred to implementation
- Residual risk: actual runtime support and net speedup not established
- Closure freshness: current

### Checks
| Check | Result | Evidence | Finding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spec contract/DoD/quality routes | PASS | PTO-002 AC, Plan Quality Contract and slices | none |
| Intent/plan/architecture consistency | PASS | mapped task scope and decisions | none |
| Dependencies/readiness | PASS | predecessor and owner gates explicit, no hidden readiness | none |
| Negative-space and consumer review | PASS | specifications-review.md task row and traces | none |
| Post-fix whole artifact review | PASS | checkpoint reservation, lifecycle and test entrypoint refinements | resolved |

### Gate Decision
- Result: PASS
- Next route: compatibility review complete; original closure remains historical

### Execution Authority
Artifact-only PASS. No high-risk implementation approval or ready implementation-range is supplied. Future start must verify owner approval, dependencies, isolation and current instructions/spec inputs.
