### Input Artifacts
| Root kind | Relative path | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| owning-project-evidence | specs/phase-3-eff-005-specification.md | 30e736ee241ae5335eec203bd1a975462928ad21de7488670fe2de17407c33cf |

### Evidence
- Artifacts-reviewed: specs/phase-3-eff-005-specification.md, context.md, owner scope EFF-DEC-001, reviews/planning-review.md, existing routing/profiles/QA consumer/schema.
- Manual-checks: scope covers seven priorities, no broad product-test repetition for runtime-only work, live semantic review retained, full CI/update retained, no fabricated approval, no historical PASS progression.
- Scope EFF-005: All QA kinds, Phase 8 and separate owner approval validate before no-clobber publication; no invented semantic verdict/approval..

### Review Completeness Gate
- Status: complete
- Reviewed baseline: a758bb4 and accepted owner plan plus hashed artifact
- Closure freshness: current
- Post-fix full re-review: not-required
- Policy-boundary adversarial matrix: completed
- Producer-consumer field audit: completed
- Required-field mapping: complete

### QA Verification Scope
- QA subject: spec-qa artifact and accepted owner scope; product implementation remains future work.

### Artifact QA Completeness Gate
- Owner intent and governing sources reviewed: context.md, EFF-DEC-001 and accepted owner plan
- DoD / phase acceptance criteria reviewed: yes
- Scope and out-of-scope consistency: aligned
- Artifact / relevant diff review: completed
- Findings-first review: completed
- Failure / rework / dependency scenarios: completed
- Repository and source compatibility: aligned
- Post-fix full artifact re-review: not-required
- Evidence reviewed: reviews/planning-review.md and scoped artifact
- Skipped or unreadable sources: none
- Residual risk: explicit dependency declarations require negative tests; synthetic benchmark cannot establish model latency.
- Closure freshness: current

### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none

### Gate Decision
- QA result: PASS
- Can proceed: yes
- Required next phase: phase-4-implementation
