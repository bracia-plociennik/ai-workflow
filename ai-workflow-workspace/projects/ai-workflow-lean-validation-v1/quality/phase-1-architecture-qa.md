# Architecture QA

## Metadata

- Project: ai-workflow-lean-validation-v1.
- Date: 2026-09-29.
- Artifact under review: architecture/phase-1-architecture.md.
- Result: PASS
- QA verification contract: `full-qa-verification-v1`
- Approval scope: owner requested this planning-range and its artifact QA; source implementation still needs separate high-risk approval.

## QA Verification Scope

Artifact correctness and planning readiness only, not implementation quality. Compared owner Plan V2, project context, current source contracts and this complete artifact.

## Artifact QA Completeness Gate

- Owner intent and governing sources reviewed: context.md, decisions/lv-decisions.md, intake/phase-0-repo-intake.md, architecture/phase-1-architecture.md, relevant phase and full-qa-verification contracts.
- DoD / phase acceptance criteria reviewed: yes.
- Scope and out-of-scope consistency: aligned.
- Artifact / relevant diff review: completed; whole new artifact, not selected lines only.
- Findings-first review: completed.
- Failure / rework / dependency scenarios: completed; review cases below.
- Repository and source compatibility: aligned; proposed changes do not take effect during planning.
- Post-fix full artifact re-review: completed; full architecture re-read after the root-allowlist/privacy correction. Initial and failed recheck evidence are retained in reviews/.
- Evidence reviewed: source inspection and manual artifact checks below.
- Skipped or unreadable sources: none needed for this artifact assessment.
- Residual risk: implementation and runtime experiments remain future evidence, never implied by artifact approval.
- Closure freshness: current.

## Checks

| Check | Result | Evidence | Finding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intent and scope | PASS | Six components address cost without removing semantic QA, approvals, coverage or canonical update validation; cache and automatic inference remain out of scope. | none |
| QA sources and reports | PASS | Separate report ownership from approved source-root allowlist; hashes can cover .systems inputs but cannot cross project boundaries, escape via symlink or open unapproved secrets. | none |
| Producer-consumer ownership | PASS | Smoke outcomes, QA/status identity, timing, scoped registry, independent groups and guidance each have one task owner and atomic consumers. | none |
| Dependency and recovery | PASS | LV001 correctness precedes LV002 baseline and optimization; unchanged monolith fallback and non-promoted LV005 are honest partial outcomes. | none |
| Current contract boundaries | PASS | Future scoped checkpoint policy is explicitly inactive now; full CI/updater and source approval remain. Planning-only work does not claim runtime performance. | none |

## Adversarial Review

- Re-traced prior P2: canonical workflow-source input is accepted by proposed hash roots while assessment remains within its project quality root; foreign assessment and symlink escape are still rejected.
- Sensitive untracked path cannot become an authorized read through a scope manifest or digest request.
- Timing parent + children cannot be summed as end-to-end cost; failed/incomplete baseline cannot support improvement.
- Equal test IDs alone cannot prove equivalence; after-call assertions and cleanup are explicit.
- Architecture approval cannot start high-risk implementation or an external-model evaluation.

## Producer-Consumer Review

Reviewed intended interfaces and their source owners; artifact-specific checks above identify the mapping. Execution assertions are acceptance tests for later implementation, not claimed test results. Required inputs cannot become optional through a smaller profile.

## Findings

- Blocking findings: none in this artifact review.
- Warnings: conditional implementation dependencies and approvals remain enforced; no implementation readiness is granted.

## Evidence

- artifacts-reviewed: architecture/phase-1-architecture.md, context.md, decisions/lv-decisions.md and current relevant source scripts/contracts.
- manual-checks: scope/DoD comparison, dependency reasoning, producer-consumer alignment, full artifact read and adversarial cases recorded above.
- command: git status --short --branch confirmed clean tracked baseline f362ce3 before artifact work.
- Script checks: targeted QA evidence and status verification follow completed semantic planning review; separate run summary records their outcome. No executable implementation exists in this range.

## Gate Decision

- result: PASS
- can-proceed: true
- Approved transition: phase-2-project-plan.
- Can enter implementation now: no; source approval and task execution dependencies are separate gates.

## Delivery Constraints QA

- Constraint source: LV-DEC-001.
- Must-have outcome: complete planning evidence with protected safety and coverage.
- Cutline/deferred scope: no safety reductions; inconclusive experiments block later promotion.
- Quality floor: DoD, semantic QA, evidence, risk and approvals unchanged.
- Overrun route: no deadline/timebox; material blockers and retry limits still stop the run.
- Result: aligned.

## Validation Execution Record

- Semantic QA result: aligned; no blocking artifact findings identified.
- Findings/blockers: none for this assessment.
- Product checks: not-applicable, no product implementation in scope.
- Workflow script applicability: targeted artifact checks after semantic QA; no broad suite.
- Targeted workflow commands: check-qa-evidence --project ai-workflow-lean-validation-v1; check-status-consistency --project ai-workflow-lean-validation-v1.
- Script evidence role: `supporting-only`
- Final verdict: artifact-level PASS only.

## Delivery Constraints

- Mode: owner-opt-out.
- Deadline: none.
- Time budget: none.
- Timezone: Europe/Warsaw.
- Owner override: LV-DEC-001; explicit no-deadline/no-timebox for this project.
- Must-have outcome: preserve safety and coverage while reducing unnecessary validation cost.
- Should-have scope: measured workflow ergonomics improvements.
- Stretch scope: none.
- Explicitly deferred scope: automatic changed-file inference, cache, production changes.
- Quality floor: semantic QA, DoD, evidence, approvals and complete required coverage.
- Cutline rule: retain monolith if equivalence is inconclusive; defer LV005 promotion if behavioral evidence is inconclusive.
- Overrun checkpoint: no calendar limit; stop on material scope/permission conflict, infrastructure blocker or retry limit.

## Model Recommendation

- Recommended: GPT-5.6 Sol High.
- Reason: contract-preservation, parser and failure-path reasoning; advisory inherited guidance, not an assertion about current model availability.
- Criticality: high for future implementation.
- Current model known: no.
- Blocking: no.

## Owner Decision Checkpoint

- Interaction mode: queued.
- Decision state: clear.
- Material decisions: none blocking this planning phase; implementation gates remain explicit.
- Questions asked: none during running.
- Auto-resolved reversible decisions: kebab-case artifact names and sequential artifact writes.
- Optional owner refinements: none.
- Decision artifacts: decisions/lv-decisions.md.
- Next route: next declared planning phase only; stop before implementation.

## Optional Knowledge Capture

- Capture recommended: yes.
- Target: decision-artifact.
- Reason: preserve approved scope, safety boundaries and dependency gates.
- Owner decision required: no additional approval for requested planning artifacts.
- Owner decision: capture-now.
- Privacy/scope check: pass.
- Suggested entry title: Lean validation planning decisions.
- Suggested entry summary: current artifact and decisions/lv-decisions.md contain the planning evidence; no ad hoc global memory write.
